# A Survey on Genetic Algorithms

This research paper provides a comprehensive overview of genetic algorithms (GAs), exploring various types, including basic, steady-state, and hybrid models. It highlights the diverse applications of GAs in fields such as neural network optimization, the traveling salesman problem, portfolio optimization, electrical circuit design, scheduling, and drug design. 

Key challenges such as premature convergence, computational demands, and parameter tuning are discussed, along with potential solutions and future scope for GAs in complex problem-solving. Published in the International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR), Volume 13, Issue 7, July 2024, this paper synthesizes foundational works and modern advancements in the field.
